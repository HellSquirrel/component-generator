### Intro

This generator was written for a series of articles "GraphQL on Rails".
It generates 3 files:

- index.js (react-ready)
- styles.module.css
- oparations.graphql

If you use components from the article, appropriate styles will be added automatically

### Usage

`npx @hellsquirrel/create-gql-component create [path-to-component]`
